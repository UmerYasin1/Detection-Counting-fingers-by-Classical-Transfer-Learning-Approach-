# Detection-Counting-fingers-by-Classical-Transfer-Learning-Approach-

# Problem Statement
Train a model on Fingers dataset to classify or detect them and prompt or massage will be generated to ask you to input required image in train model and your model will detect, is this required image or not.

# Solution:
For this project I build a web application on Django and integrate it with my train model develop on pretrained neural network VGG19 TensorFlow and after training use my  trained weights (.h5) into a function in my backend (Views.py) file and build a user interface with the help of boostrap4. 

# Functional Approach 
<ol>
<li>TensorFlow</li>
<li>Keras</li>
<li>Python </li>
<li>Django</li>
<li>Sqlite3</li>
<li>Html / CSS / Bootstrap4</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>  
<li>matplotlib</li>  
</ol>

# Data Set 
We have total 18000 fingers dataset and we split it into validation or train dataset with Â¼ ratio, and we resize these all images into (224,224) dimensions.
